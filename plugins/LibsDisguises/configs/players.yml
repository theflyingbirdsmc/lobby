# This config file is for settings that are about the players themselves, and the player disguises!

# MineSkin will at a later date give you less delay for skin requests, if you fill this in with a valid API you too can take advantage of this!
# This requires you to have a Minecraft account registered with MineSkin, that account must be owned by you and will have its skin changed constantly.

# Shall the players view their disguises?
# Best used when viewing yourself in 3rd person
ViewSelfDisguises: true

# Are self disguises enabled by default
# Default is true
ViewSelfDisguisesDefault: true

# If this is enabled and the server is 1.21+, players will be given the scale attribute to scale them up/down to the disguise's size
# This will only work on living disguises, and is false by default due to the possibility of abuse as it'd shrink hitboxes and the like
# This may behave unexpectably if you're playing with other scaling modifiers outside of this plugin!
# An example of what this setting does, is if you disguise as a cat you will be scaled down so your viewpoint is at the same height of an actual cat
# The player's move, jump, etc is unchanged
SelfDisguisesScaling: false

# The following two settings controls the min and max scale that can be applied to a self disguise so that the player's viewpoint will shrink/grow to match.
# This means they will not shrink below the min, and will not grow beyond the max
# 0.3 means 30% of the player's size. 0.72 means 72%, 2 means 200%, etc.
# The minimum scale (per Minecraft) is 0.06
SelfDisguisesScaleMin: 0.06
# The default is 1, so players can only shrink and if disguised as something larger, will not see themselves become taller
SelfDisguisesScaleMax: 1

# Shall the disguised hear their disguise sounds or their damage sounds.
# I disable this as it can be a little confusing when not used with self disguises
HearSelfDisguise: true

# Some disguises are rather big and tall and block your vision
# By default those disguises are disabled, such as zombies, players, etc.
# The baby versions however, are normally short enough that it's a non-issue
# false = hidden, true = shown
TallSelfDisguises: false

# This setting which is for servers that are 1.21+, allows the server to scale down the self disguise instead of hiding it completely
# If a player looks down, they'll see a mini figure of the previously large disguise
# This setting only works if the disguise wouldn't be shown as it's too tall, aka the above setting is false
# This will only work on living disguises!
TallSelfDisguisesScaling: true

# Hide players in tab when disguised? This means a disguised player cannot be seen when you press tab! This can be toggled on/off per disguise
HideDisguisedPlayersFromTab: false

# Always show player disguises in tab? The names will continue to appear in tab until the disguise is removed.
ShowPlayerDisguisesInTab: false

# On player disguise, a fake player is added to tablist so the skin can load properly.
# This option is ignored if 'ShowPlayerDisguisesInTab' is enabled.
# How many ticks before tab packet is sent to remove from tablist. This shouldn't need to be touched
TablistRemoveDelay: 3

# To prevent skins from defaulting to alex/steve, there is a timer that only expires after X ticks or when the player moves
# You shouldn't actually touch this, but eh. Your server.
# Default is 5 seconds
PlayerDisguisesTablistExpiresMove: 100
